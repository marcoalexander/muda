### tools needed
    - npm
    - express
    - dotenv
    - multer
    - nodemon
    - nodejs
    - aws sdk

### how to run
First install libraries using npm.
    npm install aws-sdk
    npm install --save multer

Then open two terminals, one within the front end dir and the other in the back end dir. Run the npm install command to install dependencies for both dirs. Then run npm start for front end, and nodemon server.js for back end.
